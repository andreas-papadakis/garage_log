# garage_log
Windows application in C# to keep track of clients and cars' maintenances.

This application was developed in Visual Studio 2019 with C# and SQL.
The user can create cars and owners and each car must always be paired with its owner. Afterwards, search is done using car's license plate and its maintenance history is shown. By double clicking on each maintenance, detailed info are displayed and can also be edited. As for cars' owners, the user can search them by their name and check/update their bill. When more than one results exist, all of them are being displayed. It was implemented for greek and latin characters.

Both front-end and back-end were implemented by me as the client's single requirement was to be as simple as possible.
